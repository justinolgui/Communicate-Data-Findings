    "\n",
    "This dataset contains data from over 100,000 prosper loans. <br>\n",
    "Each row contains information about a specific loan that was funded through the Prosper marketplace. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Who is prosper? <br>\n",
    "Prosper is a San Francisco based company in the peer-to-peer lending marketplace in the United States. Since 2005, Prosper has facilitated more than $15 billion in loans to more than 930,000 people. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "What is peer2peer lending? <br>\n",
    "For those who are not familiar, Prosper does not actually lend money, they essentially provide a marketplace for lenders and borrowers to meet, think online dating for loans. As a prospective borrower, you would go through the process of filling out an application, why do you want money, how much do you make, are you employed and so on. They will then assign you a Prosperscore and put your loan up on their marketplace at which point lenders who are looking for higher rate investment returns can choose to fund a portion, or the entirety of your loan. Some of the information on our borrower includes but is not limited to APR, Employment status, credit rating, term, occupation, etc. "

Since then Prosper has experienced some serious growth. Aside from the Q4 2012 and the Q1 2013 prosper loans have increased quarter over quarter since 2010 at what appears to be a parabolic rate.

This chart in isolation looks good because you have people actively taking steps to improve their financial situation. On the other hand with a mean APR of nearly 22% you have to wonder what types of loans could they possibly be consolidating that would have a rate higher than that."

Once I got to the APR distribution I started to believe that these borrowers must be in severe financial trouble. However most of the other data showed otherwise, they had slightly above average credit scores, very good debt to income ratios and minimal revolving credit balances. They also seem quite financially responsible as they are being proactive in trying to improve their financial situations by opting to consolidate their debt. However with a mean APR of 21.8% these borrowers must have taken on some really bad loans in the past. \n",

I also created a new Credit Score column that is the mean of the Upper and Lower Credit Score range columns that were initially provided. Finally, I converted the Listing Category column to a categorical datatype and swapped out the numerical value they were given with the definition provided."
